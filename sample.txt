# Sample Document for Testing DocFlow

This is a sample text document created to demonstrate the extraction capabilities of the DocFlow system.

## Purpose

This file will be used to test:
- File upload functionality
- Metadata extraction (filename, size, MIME type)
- Text content extraction
- Word count, line count, and character count calculations

## Features of DocFlow

DocFlow is a comprehensive document management system that allows users to:

1. **Organize**: Create organizations and projects to categorize documents
2. **Upload**: Upload files of various types with a simple interface
3. **Extract**: Automatically extract metadata and content from uploaded files
4. **View**: See extraction results directly in the mobile app

## Technical Stack

The system is built using:
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Database**: SQLite for data persistence
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure access
- **Mobile**: React Native for cross-platform development
- **Storage**: Local filesystem with structured folders

## Sample Content

Here's some Lorem Ipsum text to make this document more substantial:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Extraction Results

When this file is extracted, the system will generate:
- meta.json: Contains file metadata
- extracted.json: Contains the full text content and statistics
- Original file: Preserved in the storage folder

## End of Document

Thank you for testing DocFlow! This hackathon project demonstrates a complete full-stack solution with all required features implemented.
